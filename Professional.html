		<p>I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Information Sciences in the School of Information.</p>
		<p>Within my major, I am focusing on user experience analysis and design. My passion for technology started at a young age when I created a YouTube channel at 12 years old, which was dedicated to giving technology tutorials on everything from using QuickTime Player to record your computer screen to designing app icons on Photoshop and even promoting my favorite iPhone accessories. As my affinity for the digital world grew, I transitioned into helping my grandparents and other elder relatives set up and understand their own devices. From then to now, it has become clear to me that I should use my knowledge of technology to make everyone’s lives easier.</p>
		<p>This past summer I worked as a Business Development Intern for Olo, a B2B SaaS company that builds the ordering and delivery platforms for over 300 restaurant brands. While at Olo, one of my many roles was to identify new market and innovation opportunities in order to expand their product offering for their customers. One such opportunity that I identified was Apple’s upcoming App Clips feature in the new iOS 14. In my final presentation, I showed executives how the App Clips food ordering experience will affect the way consumers discover and order from restaurants, and expressed to them the possible risks of not adopting this new feature. Through this experience, I learned to embrace change and innovation so as to not get left behind in the fast-paced world of technology. At Olo, I used my technology industry knowledge combined with my analytical skills to make executives aware of a new industry standard that was coming, and how Olo could stay ahead of the curve.</p>
		<p>Inside the classroom, I have immersed myself in a curriculum rich with design and research in order to gain more valuable knowledge and skills. In my web design course, I am learning skills like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, as well as working with APIs and the POUR design principles of accessible design.  This class has encouraged me to further my own skills in front-end design, while also learning to work collaboratively with others on projects. In addition, I am learning how to use software tools to augment and review the syntax, semantics, and accessibility of designs and digital products.</p>
